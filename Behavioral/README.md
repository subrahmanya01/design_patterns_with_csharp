# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They describe not only the patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. These patterns help make interactions between objects more flexible and decoupled.

## Overview

Behavioral patterns focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other. They encapsulate complex control flows and delegate responsibilities to appropriate objects. This category includes patterns that manage object collaboration, state changes, and request handling.
